**🧮 Simple Web Calculator**
This is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand how DOM manipulation and basic JavaScript functions work together to build interactive web applications.

**🚀 Features**

➕ Addition
➖ Subtraction
✖️ Multiplication
➗ Division
🧼 All Clear (AC) button to reset the input
⌫ Delete button to remove the last entered character
☑️ Equal button to evaluate the expression
👆 Button hover and active effects
🎨 Styled interface with a clean and modern UI

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Tech | Role
HTML5 | Page structure and layout
CSS3 | Styling and button effects
JavaScript | Calculator logic and functionality
DOM Manipulation | Real-time interaction with input/output

**📘 Skills Applied & Learned**

✅ JavaScript Fundamentals
1.Declaring and calling functions
2.Using eval() to compute arithmetic expressions
3.String manipulation with .slice()

✅ DOM Manipulation
1.Handling button clicks with onclick
2.Updating input values dynamically
3.Using getElementById for interaction

✅ CSS Styling & Effects
1.Creating clean UI layouts with margin, padding, and shadows
2.Adding hover and active states for interactivity
3.Using :hover and :active pseudo-classes

✅ Responsive Thinking

2.Structuring the calculator grid manually with <br> and <button>


**🧠 Things I Learned**

1.How to implement a calculator from scratch using only frontend tech
2.The use of eval() in JavaScript for expression evaluation
3.DOM handling and event-driven development
4.The importance of user experience with intuitive layouts and UI feedback

**🔮 Future Improvements**

1.Keyboard support (e.g. pressing numbers on keyboard)
2.Prevent invalid expressions (e.g. ++, ..)
3.Dark/light theme toggle
4.Responsive design for mobile devices
